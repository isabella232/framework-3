Searchbox/Search Framework
=========
Searchbox is a Search Framework developed under java/spring which enables you as a developer or CIO to easily leverage backend search engines such as Apache Solr, ElasticSearch and Google Site Search in an easy way.

**Some of the goals for the project are that it should**

* be easy to leverage Apache Solr, ElasticSearch or Google Site Search
* be easy to extend by adding new components or new adapters for search engines
* be flexible
* be user-friendly on all platforms (desktop, tablet and mobile)
* have good code quality (use SonarSource)
* have good documentation
* be the best search engine framework

Usage

In order to quickly get started with the framework, you can run it from the command line:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:searchbox/framework.git
$ cd framework
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port 8080 target/*.war
